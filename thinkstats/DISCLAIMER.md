This directory contains data files from the National Survey of Family Growth 
(NSFG), for use with the book Think Stats by Allen B. Downey.

These data are also available from the CDC; the only difference is that the 
files here are compressed with gzip. Note: if you have any problems using the 
compressed versions, please contact the author, not the CDC.

Federal law provides that these data may be used only for the purpose of 
health statistical reporting and analysis. Any effort to determine the 
identity of any person or establishment is prohibited.

By downloading these data, you signify your agreement to comply with the 
following legal requirements:

    1. To use these data for statistical reporting and analysis only;
    2. To make no use of the identity of any person or establishment 
    discovered inadvertently and advise the Director, NCHS, of any such 
    discovery; and
    3. To not link this data set with individually identifiable data from any 
    other data set.

In addition to those legal requirements, I would like to add the following 
ethical reminder:

    * These files contain data collected from people who were asked to 
    provide personal information for statistical purposes. Some of this 
    information may be considered sensitive.
    * Statisticians should work with this or any other statistical data with 
    appropriate respect for the people who answered the questions.
